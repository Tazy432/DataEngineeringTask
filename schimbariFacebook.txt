We have 16 columns. All of them were used as strings, all of them got their trailing/leading whitespaces erased Some of them were cleaned, in the following way:

domain  :

address : -> used to contain duplicate data(data that could be found in other cells aswell).The duplicate data is removed
        ex:
            Before :134 rue entrepreneurs, za du vigné, 30420, calvisson, france, languedoc-roussillon
            After  :134 rue entrepreneurs,za du vigné,languedoc-roussillon
            

          ->used to contain strange characters due to the wrong decoding. Applied the method fix_text from module ftfy
        ex:
            Before :Î±Î½Î´ÏÎέÎ± Ï€Î±Ï€Î±Î½Î´ÏÎέÎ¿Ï… 13, 15122, amaroÃºsion, greece, attica (region)
            After  :ανδρÎέα παπανδρÎέου 13, 15122, amaroúsion, greece, attica (region)

city:

country_code: ->it could be empty. But if we did have the name of the country, we could easily find its country code using the scraped data
            ex:(suppose the country_name is france)
                Before:""
                After :fr 

country_name: ->it could be empty. But if we did have the code of the country, we could easily find its country name using the scraped data

                Before:""
                After :france

email: ->We checked the shape of the email . If the shape is wrong, we change it to "WRONG"          
        ex:
            Before :ana are mere
            After  :WRONG

phone: ->We checked the shape of the phone number. If the number of characters is different than 11 and its not null, we change it to "WRONG"
        ex:
            Before :688654212
            After  :WRONG

       ->We checked how the phone number starts .If the string representing the phone number doesnt start with the phone code of it's country
       (if it exists ofc) we change it to "WRONG"
       ex: (suppose we have a phone number from spain => phone country code=34)
            Before :77756786596
            After  :WRONG

       ->We added a '+' before all correct shaped phone numbers
        ex:(suppose we have a phone number from spain => phone country code=34)
            Before :34756786596
            After  :+34756786596

       ->If the number is in a scientific notation , we transform it into its normal phone string
       ex:
            Before :4.4118E+11
            After  :441180000000
